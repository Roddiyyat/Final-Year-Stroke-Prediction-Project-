# Final-Year-Stroke-Prediction-Project-
For my final year university project, i'm going to be building a machine learning model that can predict stroke prevalence in the general population based on a few demographics.

I'm collecting my data from University of Ilorin Teaching Hospital; and adding them to a spreadsheet, this spreedsheet will be converted to a csv file that we will use to build our ML Model.
I'm going to be updating this repository along the way and dropping the update here along the way.
